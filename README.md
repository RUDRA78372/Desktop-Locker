# Desktop-Locker
A regular desktop locker that requires password to unlock. The application captures a photo using webcam if user fails to write the correct password.


Tip: 1. I have created this locker for my personal use. 
My PC has a webcam so this locker doesn't have a check for webcam and automatically uses it. 
If you don't have one, please edit the source for your use.

2. Ctrl+Alt+Del still works when locked.
